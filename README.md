## Introduction

Why do 30% of patients miss their scheduled appointments?

This is an EDA and prediction modeling for a dataset that includes medical appointment status as well as some details of Brazilian patients. I'm investigating the reason why some patients do not show up to their scheduled appointments and also navigating the complexity of imbalanced learning in a challenging dataset; aiming to develop a predictive model addressing patient's no-show problem.

Training a machine learning model on an imbalanced dataset can be quite challenging. Imbalanced data is where the distribution of examples across the known classes is biased or skewed.
 
Generally, for easy classification problems in which there's a clear separation in the data, class imbalance doesn't hinder model's ability to learn effectively. However, this is not the case for datasets that are inherently more difficult to learn from.

If you are a machine learning researcher and can do better than the current model for this particular dataset, I'd like to hear from you.
