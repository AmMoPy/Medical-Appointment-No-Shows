## Introduction

Why do 30% of patients miss their scheduled appointments?

This is an EDA and prediction modeling for a dataset that includes medical appointment status as well as some patient details of Brazilian families; I'm investigating the reason why some patients do not show up to their scheduled appointments and whether there are opportunities for improvement in appointment administration that would result in a higher attendance frequency.

Training a machine learning model on an imbalanced dataset can be quite challenging. Imbalanced data is where the distribution of examples across the known classes is biased or skewed.
 
Generally, for easy classification problems in which there's a clear separation in the data, class imbalance doesn't hinder model's ability to learn effectively. However, this is not the case for datasets that are inherently more difficult to learn from.
 
I'm navigating the complexity of imbalanced learning and a challenging dataset, aiming to develop a predictive model addressing patient's no-show problem.

If you are a machine learning researcher and can do better than the current model for this particular dataset, I'd like to hear from you.
